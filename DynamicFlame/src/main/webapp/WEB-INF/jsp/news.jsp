								<h3>Vic Park Examiner Article</h3>
								<span class="byline"> June 13th, 2012 </span>
								<p>After playing badminton for only 18 months Sophie Leonard, 15, is heading to the Sunshine Coast, Queensland to
									represent Western Australia at the national under 15s championships in October. Sophie is a member of the Dynamic Flame
									badminton club and trains at Leisurelife Centre, Victoria Park on Friday nights. She started playing the sport after
									being introduced to it at school and now trains five days a week.</p>
								<p>“I play the general school sports then most of the time I just play badminton, that’s all I have time for
									because I train so much,” she said.</p>
								<p>“For now just going to Queensland is a big thing for me and that was probably my goal, after that I don’t know
									where I’ll go, I’ll reset my goals and go from there”. “It’s not all about winning, it just about trying your
									best.”</p>
								<p>Sophie’s mum Tonia said badminton could be played at all ages. “You can learn it as a young kid and play it
									when you’re 80, it’s something you can pick up and play throughout your life and it has its benefits, it’s indoors,
									you’re not going to get sunburnt, you’re not going to get flooded out and you only need one set of equipment,” she
									said. “It’s going to be a great experience for Sophie because we have no idea how good the other state players are
									and apparently they are fantastic.”</p>
								<p>Sophie spends her spare time volunteering, particularly for the Australian Orang-utan project.</p>
								<p>Fellow club member Shelby Milne, 15, also had success recently finishing in the top 16 at the under 17s national
									badminton championships in Hobart, Tasmania.</p>
								<p>Head coach Norman Anthony has trained players to state, national and international levels. He said badminton was
									all about fun, fitness and friendship with a scope to play at any level and the club was encouraging more players to join
									up.</p>
								<p>The club trains on Friday nights from 5 pm at Leisurelife Centre and other venues throughout the week and caters
									for all ages and abilities.</p>
								<p>For more information call Norm Anthony on 0413 562 421 .</p>
